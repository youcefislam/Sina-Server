# Sina

Sina is a medical mobile and web application, developed for medical telemonitoring of cardiac patients.
This is my Master's end-of-studies project. I had the honor to work with the instrumentation laboratory of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in my university, where i used their on-board electronic device for continuous data acquisition to receive real-time data via bluetooth, analyze it, trace it in the mobile application and the web application if the patient's doctor is watching and then send it to the server to be stored in the database when the monitoring is stopped.
